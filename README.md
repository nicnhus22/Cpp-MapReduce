Cpp-MapReduce
=============

This takes input files that contain a lot of information, reads questions from a file and generates an essay answering those questions.

Project I did to practise MapReduce. I reused code from my Cpp-GoogleFrequencyDoc project and integrated it using MapReduce to be able to manipulate a large number of files. MapReduce allowed me to automatically split the work into different steps that can be performed concurrently. To compare the speed, I created the same project without MapReduce and I could observe that it was 3 times slower.

Note: Built this project using QtCreator.
